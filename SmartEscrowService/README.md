# SmartEscrowService

## **Project Description**
SmartEscrowService is a blockchain-based escrow system built on the Core Testnet network.  
It ensures secure and transparent transactions between buyers and sellers by locking funds in a smart contract until both parties approve the release or an arbiter resolves the dispute.  
This eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries and enables trustless peer-to-peer transactions.

## **Project Vision**
To build a decentralized, transparent, and automated escrow service that ensures fair and secure digital transactions.  
The goal is to minimize fraud, disputes, and mistrust in peer-to-peer commerce by leveraging smart contract automation on blockchain technology.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Two-Party Approval:** Funds are only released when both buyer and seller approve.  
- **Arbiter Refund Mechanism:** A trusted arbiter can refund the buyer if disputes arise.  
- **Automated Execution:** Once approved, funds are instantly transferred to the seller.  
- **Immutable Records:** All transactions and approvals are recorded permanently on-chain.  
- **Secure Escrow Storage:** Funds remain locked in the contract until release or refund.

---

## **Future Scope**
- Integrate **multi-party escrow** for complex transactions.  
- Add **time-based auto-release** (e.g., auto-release funds after a set duration).  
- Implement a **DAO-based arbitration system** for decentralized dispute resolution.  
- Build a **frontend dashboard** for escrow creation, approval, and tracking.  
- Expand deployment to **Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon** networks.
